## 🔌 Centralized API & Socket Configuration

In your Flutter app, all backend URLs are stored in:

```dart
lib/app/constant/api_endpoints.dart
```

```dart
static const String baseHost = "http://192.168.1.85:5000";
static const String socketUrl = "http://192.168.1.85:5000";
static const String lmStudioBase = "http://192.168.1.85:1234";
```

Change these once to update across your entire app.

## 📡 Socket.IO – Realtime Booking Chat

### ✅ Server

Socket.IO is set up in the backend to:
- Join chat room via `bookingId`
- Send and receive messages

### ✅ Flutter Client

```dart
_socket = IO.io(ApiEndpoints.socketUrl, <String, dynamic>{
  'transports': ['websocket'],
  'autoConnect': false,
});

_socket.connect();

_socket.onConnect((_) {
  _socket.emit('joinRoom', bookingId);
});
```
